**May 2022 :** I am excited to be joining Google Research for an internship and working on variational inference on deep switching dynamical systems!

**Mar 2021 :** I am excited to be joining MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab for an internship in summer 2021, advised by [Soumya Ghosh](http://soumyaghosh.com/).

**Dec 2020 :** Two extended abstracts will appear at [AABI 2021](http://approximateinference.org): One work on [Conjugate Energy-Based Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=4k58RmAD02&noteId=OZ0M-w_wZ_P) and one work on [Nested Variational Inference](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tvxL1eqPl9Y).
