<p>Welcome to my website! I am researcher in Machine Learning, with expertises in Deep Generative Modeling, Amortized Variational Inference, and Probabilistic Programming. Essentially I am interested in developing machine learning systems that can generalize to sparse data, provide data-efficient inference, and uncover structure from data. Check out my <a href="/assets/hao_research_statement.pdf">Research Statement</a> for details.

I acquired my Ph.D degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University, where I was advised with Prof. <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jwvdm/">Jan-Willem van de Meent</a>. Before that I had my M.Sc in Computer Science at University of Virginia and my M.Sc in Applied Mathematics from University of Washington.
